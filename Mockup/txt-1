<h1>CSS Zen Garden Mockup</h1>

<p>For this project, I decided to go with a linear design that scrolls down directly with text overlayed over images to add dimension.</p>

<p>I want to mix an artistic header for CSS Zen Garden with relating color and imagery.</p> <p>It will be pretty simple and not have a ton of movement or motion but will be easy to navigate and get information. I feel like this is the best for my level of skill in CSS right now.</p>
